# About this Repository
This repository contains my final project (in collaboration with Jack Leland '23, Andrew Pace '24, and Ibraheem Khan '23) for ECON 1071: Incentives in the Wild - from Tanking in Sports to Mining Cryptocurrencies. This course was taken during my time as undergraduate student at Harvard during the Fall '22 semester. The project centers around modeling the effects of luxury taxes in the NBA on parity and revenue and using simulations to determine the optimal rate and cap for those taxes.
